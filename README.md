# Head-Tracking-Device-Headset-for-Robotic-Head-System

This project is a further continuation on my internship project, the Development of Advanced Intelligent Manipulation (AIM), where I further utilised the GY-85 9 DOF IMU sensor in measuring the roll angle. 

With the calculation of the yaw, pitch and roll angles of the IMU sensor, this provides greater accuracy for the robotic head system to mimic the head movements of the user.

Thus, I also designed a CAD model of a pan-tilt-roll system with SolidWorks, so as to improve the design of the robotic head system by providing it with a greater range of freedom in movement.
